    "> - We always keep track of the number of pulls of the lever and the amount of rewards we have received from that lever.\n",
    "> - 10% of the time, we choose a lever at random.\n",
    "> - The other 90% of the time, we choose the lever that has the highest expectation of rewards. If several meet this criterion, then we take the first one.\n",
    "> - We initialize all three choices to 1 win out of 1 try. It doesn't really matter what we initialize them too, because the algorithm will adapt.\n",
    "> - The randomization of 10% of trials forces the algorithm to explore the options. It is a trade-off between trying new things in hopes of something better, and sticking with what it knows will work. There are several variations of the epsilon-greedy strategy. In the epsilon-first strategy, you can explore 100% of the time in the beginning and once you have a good sample, switch to pure-greedy. "
